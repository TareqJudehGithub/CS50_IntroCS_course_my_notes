Python Notes
 - Python is indentation-sensitive.
 - Python uses Interpreter executing code line by line.
 - Python supports strings with single quotes and double quotes unlike C and Java.
 - Python logical operators: AND, OR, NOT.
 - Python uses in keyword.. very powerful feature in Python.
 - Python conditional structure: if, elif, and else.
 - Python loop:  while and for.  There's no do loop in Python.
    for i in (int):
      do something
 - Python lists.
    my_list = list()
    my_list = [1, 2, 3]
    my_list.append(4)
    
 - Python list Comprehension
    my_list = [x for x in range(10)]
 
 - Tuples. Ordered, immutable, set of data.
  List of Tuples: 
    scores = [
      ("John", 79),
      ("Sarah", 88)
  ]
  - Loop over scores:
    for name, score in scores:
    print(f"{name} scored {score}")
 
 - Dictionary.  pair of and keys: values
    pizzas = {
      "cheese": 9,
      "pepperoni": 10,
      "vegetable": 11,
      "buffalo chicken": 7
    }
    Edit key:
    pizzas["cheese"] = 10

    loop over dicts
    for key, value in pizzas.items():
    print(key, value)
