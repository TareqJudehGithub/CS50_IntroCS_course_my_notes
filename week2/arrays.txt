Arrays in C

 - We can store elements in array.
 - All elements should be of the same data type (int, char, str)
 - Elements inside an array can be accessed directly by index
 - First element in arrays starts from 0 (not 1)
 - Last element is located at index at n - 1  (total elements - 1)

 Array declaration
  type name[size];
   type: array elements data type
   name: meaningful array name
   size: number of elements inside the array

  examples:
   int numbers[5];
   string countries[3];

  instantiation syntax:
  int numbers[] = {2, 3, 1, 6, 3, 5};

  individual element syntax:
  bool truthtable[3];
  truthtable[0] = false;
  truthtable[1] = true;
  truthtable[3] = false;


  Two-dimensional array:
  bool battleship[10][10];
    it's like 10*10 grid of cells
  
  in C, we must loop over all elements of one array and assign them to 
  another array. but we cannot directly assign one array to another using
  = assignment.
