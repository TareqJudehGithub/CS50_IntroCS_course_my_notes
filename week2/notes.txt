$ clang -o hello hello.c -lcs50

Compiling steps:
  Preprocessing => Compiling => Assembling => Linking
     1. Preprocessing 
          looks for any line that starts with # symbol (#include) 
          line, copy/paste its content, replacing the actual code for these
          libraries. 

     2. compiling 
          To take this C (user's source code), and to convert it to 
          another source code (called Assembly code).

     3. assembling 
          converts the assembly code, into machine code (0s and 1s).

     4. linking => takes all machines codes and link them into a one big file 
     that contain all machines codes assembled. 

clang
     clang is a C language complier.

     $clang -o playground playground.c -lcs50
     -o for output  => outputs a file called playground 
     take playground.c as an input
     -lcs50 link cs50 libraries.

make 
     make automates compiling.
     $make playground
     $./playgroup


Debugging in C 

1.   printf() to debug. Very cool tool.
2.   debug50 ./compiled_file   => step by step debugging.
  Call stack: All of the functions that ur program at that point of time has
  executed but has not returned from.

Memory
     Data Types size in memory:
     bool      1 bytes
     char      1 bytes
     double    8 bytes
     float     4 bytes
     int       4 bytes
     long      8 bytes
     string    ? bytes


#include <string.h>
     #include <string.h> // strlen()
     #include <string.h>   // function for calling strlen()
     strlen() function requires %li (long) data type.

#include <ctype.h>  // islower(), isupper(), tolower(), toupper()


#include <stdio.h>

params for function main: argc as int, and argv as an array
 argc is a shorthand notation for argument count, the number of words users
 will type in input.
 argv is a shorthand notation for argument vector, vector a fancy way of saying
 list, it is a variable that is going to store in an array, all of the words the
 user type in argc.

     int main(int argc, string argv[])  
     {
     
     }

Why int main(void) starts with int?
     programmers refer to integers/numbers to describe /messages/errors/warnings.
