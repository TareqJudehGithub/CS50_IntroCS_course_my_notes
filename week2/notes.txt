Compiling steps:
     1. Preprocessing => look for any line that starts with # symbol (#include) 
     line, copy/paste its content, replacing the actual code for these
     libraries.

     2. compiling => To take this C (user's source code), and to convert it to 
     another source code (called assembly code).

     3. assembling => convert the assembly code, into machine code (0s and 1s).

     4. linking => takes all machines codes and link them into a one big file 
     that contain all machines codes assembled. 

clang
     clang is a C language complier.

     $clang -o playground playground.c -lcs50
     -o output
     output a file called playground 
     take playground.c as an input
     -lcs50 link cs50 libraries.

make 
     make automates compiling.
     $make playground
     $./playgroup


Debugging in C 

1.   printf() to debug. Very cool tool.
2.   debug50 ./compiled_file   => step by step debugging.
