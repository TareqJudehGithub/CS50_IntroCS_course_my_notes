Computer Science (CS)
 Computer science is the study of algorithmic processes, computational machines 
 and computation itself.
 CS is to solve problems.
 Computers use binary system (0 and 1).

 bits
     1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256
     8 bits represents 256

 ASCII  - mapping letters to numbers
     A = 65
     B == 66
     C = 67

72 73 33 = hi!


Unicode supports all human spoken languages, unlike bits which only supports English.


Algorithms: A step by step instructions to solving problems.
    A function: an action that gets the computer to do something.
    condition: wether to do this or that.
    boolean expression: wether a true or a false answer.
    loop: a programming construct, to repeat some code again and again.
