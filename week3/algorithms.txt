Algorithms


Running-Time. The time needed for an algorithm to finish executing.

Big O
  - O(n) Big O of n
  - O(n/2) Big O of n over 2
  - O(log sub2 n) Big O of log over based 2 of n
  - O(1)  
  - O(log n)
  - O(n sup2)  Big O of n square 2


Linear Search:   searching for an item step by step. Like searching for a phone
  number in a phone book, searching page by page.

  for i from 0 to n-1
  if number behind i'th door
    return true
  return false

Binary Search 
 If number behind middle door
  return true
 else if number < middle door
  Search left half
else if number > middle door
  Search right half


strcmp() function
 Part of the <string.h> library

strcmp(look_in, look_for))  // string compare
 If look_for = look_in   strcmp() returns 0
 If look_for < look_in   strcmp() returns -1
 If look_for > look_in   strcmp() returns 1



What is "Algorithm"?
     A set of steps for computer program to accomplish a task.

     Input Data => Do complex Calculations (code) => Output


     Example: How does Google Maps work? 
     They use a Route finding algorithms.

     What makes a good algorithm?
     good algorithms solve problems, and  makes programs runs faster and more
     efficient.

     Asymptotic Analysis
      Allows algorithms to be compared independently of a particular 
      programming language or hardware.

     
     guessing Game:
     linear search: guess all numbers lined up in a row. 
     A good example of linear search in programming is using for loop algorithm.

     Binary search: by eliminating half the numbers till we guess the right 
     number.
     
     Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted 
     list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the 
     list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible 
     locations to just one. We used binary search in the guessing game 
     introduced in the introductory tutorial (Khan academy).
     
     - In order to leverage the use of Binary search, we first need to SORT our
       array, else we cannot make assumptions about the array's contents.

    Data Structure in C
      Data Structure is a user-defined data type that can store multiple related
      items.

      // Data Structure
      typedef struct
      {
          string name;
          string number;
      }
      person;

    Bubble Sorting
     The largest element is shifted all the way to the end of the array.
     with loops, the array should get sorted from smaller to greater elements.
